# Improved Radar
improved-radar is a FiveM resource that displays a DOJ style radar.

This is a remake of my older radar script, known as `radar`, to enhance the menu system and be more realistic.

## Features
* Able to change radar direction with button on the radar
* Easy to change fast speed
* Both Kmh and Mph (changeable by user)
* Reset button to delete last fast speed
* Using NUI so you can easily edit the css to change the look

## Usage
1. Open the radar with `CTRL`+`M`
2. Click the buttons with the cursor to change the settings
3. Exit the cursor screen with `ESC`
4. Profit
